#  Linked List Implementation (A04) - Semeion Stafford
##  Commenting C++ Code
### Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This program implements a linked list class with descriptive comments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Method
This program implements a class that allows a linked list to be used just like  an array. It overloads the "[]" (square brackets) to simulate accessing seperate  array elements, but really it traverses the list to find the specified node using an index value. It also overloads the "+" and "-" signs allowing a user to "add" or "push" items onto the end of the list, as well as "pop" items off the end of our array. This class is not meant to replace the STL vector library, its simply a project to introduce the beginnings of creating complex / abstract data types.
