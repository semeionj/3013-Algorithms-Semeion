#  Array Based Stack (P01) - Semeion Stafford
##  Class implementing an array based stack
### Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview of a class implementing an array based stack which resized based on current number of elements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Method
Using the dictionary provided here and the newly discovered keylength, find all words in the dictionary of same length and proceed to brute force your way into decrypting the ciphertext.

|   1   | break_vig.py         | Main driver of my project that launches code.      |
|   2   | decrypted.txt         | Decrption when manual key size of 7 is entered      |
|   3   | dictionary.json         | JSON file with dictoionary words and definitions      |


Issues Faced:
Tried several methods for determining the actual key size. But eventually could not get it to work.

### Instructions
- My program expects four parameters to be placed on the command line when you run the program.
- Parameters `<input file>`

- Example Command:
    - `python python adfgx.py inputfile
    - `python adfgx.py input.txt
